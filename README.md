# B-Boy YouTube Data Analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow using public YouTube data related to breaking (b-boy) battles.

The goal is to show the ability to:
- Pull data from a public API
- Store data in a PostgreSQL database
- Query the data using SQL
- Analyze and visualize results in R

This is a small, focused project intended to demonstrate core data engineering and analysis skills.
